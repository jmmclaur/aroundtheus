# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

'Around the US' is a website showcasing all elements displaying correctly for desktop, tablet and mobile screen sizes with media queries. I exported images from Figma and optimized them on tinify. Fonts were uploaded from rsms.me/inter. The repository was created in Github and connected with Gitbash to VSC.

Sprint 7: In this sprint, I focused on using object-oriented-programming to consolidate code. I created a components section to include Card.js and FormValidator.js, where both files were exported to index.js.
