**Intro**

'Around the US' is a website showcasing all elements displaying correctly for desktop, tablet and mobile screen sizes with media queries. I exported images from Figma and optimized them on tinify. Fonts were uploaded from rsms.me/inter. The repository was created in Github and connected with Gitbash to VSC.
